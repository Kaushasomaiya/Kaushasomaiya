Implemented Changes as part of Task:1.
1. In planet.cs class 'AverageMoonGravity' was readonly changed it to getter & setter;
1. I have added gravity property in side Moon class and fetch it from API.
2. Once we fetch all moon data with grevity,assigned average value of grevity in 'AverageMoonGravity' property.
3. I have added grevity propery for planet also, but it may not required so probebaly we can remove it.(Added 'gravity' parameter in URL : public const string GetAllPlanetsWithMoonsQueryParameters =
            BodiesUri + "?data=id,semiMajorAxis,gravity,moons,moon,rel&filter[]=isPlanet,neq,false";L)
4. Other properties will remain as it is as describe in document.
5. Printed data loading and wriring messeges(LoggerMessage.cs)
6. Added common method for exception.

Task:2 : We can fetch data of moon with grevity in sigle call and can calculate value of 'AverageMoonGravity'.(Mentioned in details : In 'can make changes' section)

Can make changes.
1. We are calling _planetService.GetAllPlanets() method 2 times for different method, we can make single call for it.
2. We also have api call in loop(moon wise individual call), to get moon data(using UriPath.GetMoonByIdQueryParameters), we should remove it from loop and make it single call.
